# Driver notes

## `/dev/null`

`$ testdevnull` will attempt to write "Hello" to the `/dev/null` driver. Upon success, the program will notify the number of bytes written to the driver (expected 5). If it fails, an error will be written to `stderr`.

### Expected behavior from the driver

1. Writing to `/dev/null` should throw the input into the void.
1. Reading from `/dev/null` should return nothing.

## `/dev/zero`

`$ testdevzero` will read from `/dev/zero` once, printing the driver's output upon success (expected 0).

### Expected behavior from the driver

1. Writing to `/dev/zero` will return the number of bytes that were expected to be written. It should do nothing with the input though. xv6 will complain about being unable to open the driver for writing.
1. Reading from `/dev/zero` should return `0`

## `/dev/ticks`

`$ testdevticks` will read from the `/dev/ticks` driver, printing the number of ticks elapsed since xv6 started.

### Expected behavior from the driver

1. Writing to `/dev/ticks` will return the number of bytes that were expected to be written. It should do nothing with the input. xv6 will complain about being unable to open the driver for writing.
1. Reading from `/dev/ticks` should return the number of ticks that have elapsed since xv6 initialized.
